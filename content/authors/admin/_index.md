      I studied the foundational concept of neural networks and deep learning. By the end, I was familiar with the significant technological trends driving the rise of deep learning; build, train, and apply fully connected deep neural networks; implement efficient (vectorized) neural networks; identify key parameters in a neural network’s architecture; and apply deep learning to your own applications.

    summary: |
      Object-oriented programming (OOP) lets you specify relationships between functions and the objects that they can act on, helping you manage complexity in your code. This is an intermediate level course, providing an introduction to OOP, using the S3 and R6 systems. S3 is a great day-to-day R programming tool that simplifies some of the functions that you write. R6 is especially useful for industry-specific analyses, working with web APIs, and building GUIs.

<!-- ## About Me -->

I am a postdoctoral researcher at the [MilaNLP Lab](https://milanlproc.github.io/) at Bocconi University, where I work with [Dirk Hovy](https://dirkhovy.com/). Starting 2026, I will join the [Stanford NLP Group](https://nlp.stanford.edu/) as a postdoc, working with [Diyi Yang](https://cs.stanford.edu/~diyiy/) and [Sanmi Koyejo](https://cs.stanford.edu/~sanmi/).

I obtained my PhD in Computer Science at the University of Zurich, where I was advised by [Anikó Hannák](https://www.ifi.uzh.ch/en/scg/people/hannak.html).
I spent the summer of 2022 as a Data Science for Social Good Fellow at Carnegie Mellon University, advised by [Rayid Ghani](http://www.rayidghani.com/) and [Kit Rodolfa](https://law.stanford.edu/kit-rodolfa/). During my PhD (2023-2024), I also interned at the Max Planck Institute for Intelligent Systems in Tübingen, hosted by [Celestine Mendler-Dünner](https://celestine.ai/) and [Moritz Hardt](https://mrtz.org/). I was also fortunate to collaborate extensively with [Christoph Heitz](https://www.zhaw.ch/en/about-us/person/heit/) throughout my doctoral studies.

My research spans machine learning, natural language processing, and computational social science, always with an eye toward understanding and improving the real-world impact of these technologies on society.
I am broadly interested in the societal impact of AI. During my PhD, I worked extensively on algorithmic fairness and algorithmic collective action as mechanisms to contest power imbalances in AI systems. I am also deeply interested in exploring both the promises and risks of using large language models for social science research methods.
